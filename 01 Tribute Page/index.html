                        <strong>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde</strong> (16 October 1854
                        â€“ 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in
                        different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of the most
                        popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is best
                        remembered for his epigrams and plays, his novel
                        <em>
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray" target="_blank">
                                The Picture of Dorian Gray
                            </a>
                        </em>
                        , and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency
                        for consensual homosexual acts in "one of the first celebrity trials",
                        imprisonment, and early death from meningitis at age 46.

                        Wilde's parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. He became associated
                        with the emerging philosophy of <strong>aestheticism</strong>, led by two of his
                        tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to
                        London into fashionable cultural and social circles.

                    <p>
                        As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published
                        a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new "English Renaissance in
                        Art" and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a
                        journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill,
                        Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he
                        refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and
                        incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, <em>The
                        Picture of Dorian Gray </em> (1890).
