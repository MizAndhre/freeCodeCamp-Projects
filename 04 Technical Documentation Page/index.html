        <p>
          <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a declarative
          language that controls how webpages look in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to
          display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and
          their values, which determine how a webpage looks.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and
          JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used
          with other markup languages like SVG or XML.
        </p>

        <p>
          A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector.
          "Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are
          prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important
          feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
          start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
          and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
          For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
          spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features.
        </p>

        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <li>
          You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
          recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
          learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
          between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
          and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really
          learn CSS without knowing HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
          computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it,
          consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
          up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to
          create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of
          which are parts of our

          This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS
          mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
          and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

      <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_the_document">
        <header>Adding CSS to the document</header>
        <p>
          The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
          we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
          ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
          across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
          way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as
          <span>styles.css</span>. The <span>.css</span> extension shows that
          this is a CSS file.
        </p>
        <p>
          To link <span>styles.css</span> to <span>index.html</span> add the
          following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>
        <p>
          This <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> element tells the browser that we have
          a stylesheet, using the <span>rel</span> attribute, and the location
          of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test
          that the CSS works by adding a rule to <span>styles.css</span>. Using
          your code editor add the following to your CSS file:
        </p>
        <code>h1 { color: red; }</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_elements">
        <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
        <p>
          By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can
          target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element
          selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element
          name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the
          selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:
        </p>
        <code>p { color: green; }</code>
        <p>
          You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors
          with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green
          my rule looks like this:
        </p>
        <code>p, li { color: green; }</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
        <header>Adding a class</header>
        <p>
          So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This
          works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your
          document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so
          you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without
          changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class
          to your HTML element and target that class.
        </p>
        <p>
          In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item.
          Your list will now look like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>&lt;ul&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em>&lt;/li&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
        </code>
        <p>
          In your CSS you can target the class of <span>special</span> by
          creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the
          following to your CSS file:
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>.special {</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>color: orange;</p>
          <p>font-weight: bold;</p>
          <p>}</p>
        </code>
        <p>
          You can apply the class of <span>special</span> to any element on your
          page that you want to have the same look as this list item.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Pseudo-classes">
        <header>Pseudo-classes</header>
        <p>
          A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a
          special state of the selected element(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, <span>:hover</span> can be used to change a button's
          color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */</p>
          <p>button:hover {</p>
          <p>color: blue;</p>
          <p>}</p>
        </code>

        <p>
          Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in
          relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to
          external factors like the history of the navigator
          (<span>:visited</span>, for example), the status of its content (like
          <span>:checked</span> on certain form elements), or the position of
          the mouse (like <span>:hover</span>, which lets you know if the mouse
          is over an element or not).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Pseudo-elements">
        <header>Pseudo-elements</header>
        <p>
          A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you
          style a specific part of the selected element(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, <span>::first-line</span> can be used to change the font
          of the first line of a paragraph.
        </p>

        <code>
          <p>/* The first line of every &lt;p&gt; element. */</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>p::first-line {</p>
          <p>color: blue;</p>
          <p>text-transform: uppercase;</p>
          <p>}</p>
        </code>

        <p>
          You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. It must appear
          after the simple selectors in the statement.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Logical_Properties_and_Values">
        <header>CSS Logical Properties and Values</header>
        <p>
          CSS Logical Properties and Values is a module of CSS introducing
          logical properties and values that provide the ability to control
          layout through logical, rather than physical, direction and dimension
          mappings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The module also defines logical properties and values for properties
          previously defined in CSS 2.1. Logical properties define
          direction‐relative equivalents of their corresponding physical
          properties.
        </p>

        <h4>Block vs. Inline</h4>
        <p>
          Logical properties and values use the abstract terms block and inline
          to describe the direction in which they flow. The physical meaning of
          these terms depends on the writing mode.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Block dimension</strong></p>
        <li>
          The dimension perpendicular to the flow of text within a line, i.e.,
          the vertical dimension in horizontal writing modes, and the horizontal
          dimension in vertical writing modes. For standard English text, it is
          the vertical dimension.
        </li>
        <p><strong>Inline dimension</strong></p>
        <li>
          The dimension parallel to the flow of text within a line, i.e., the
          horizontal dimension in horizontal writing modes, and the vertical
          dimension in vertical writing modes. For standard English text, it is
          the horizontal dimension.
